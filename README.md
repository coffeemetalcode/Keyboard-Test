The first 2 white keys - C3 and D3 - are working.

Obviously, we'll do the note variables as an object or array, and make the js dynamic so it can just pick-up the note values from the key element classes, but as a test case, this works.

We'll also route the note on/off to keyboard onKeyDown / onKeyUp, etc. But it's probably mandatory that the keys activate on mouse clicks as well, since that will carryover to touch screens (I think).
